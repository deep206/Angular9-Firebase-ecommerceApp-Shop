# Shop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.
This is another version of https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/organic-shop which was developed using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 4.x.

This project uses Firebase as its back end service for storing data, authentication, etc purposes.

Benefits of this project: It uses newer version of NPM packages, Angular CLI and many other packages that had major updates after Mosh published his angular course. Many APIs also changed, for eg: angularfire2, rxjs, etc.
This project would be good for reference for those who are enrolled in Mosh's Angular course and especially for those who are coding from scratch, the source code in this repository could help them solve various unexpected errors.

P.S. Anyone who is looking to learn front-end/back-end/full-stack development is highly recommended to take any relevant course from Mosh's many courses, that can be found on various platforms like Pluralsight, Udemy, or even his own platform.

Happy Coding!

## Firebase Setup Note

You will have to setup your own firebase project and copy the config from your firebase project and paste it in the environments.ts and environments.prod.ts files.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
