# Shop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.
This is another version of https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/organic-shop which was developed using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 4.x.

This project uses Firebase as its back end service for storing data, authentication, etc purposes.

Benefits of this project: It uses newer version of NPM packages, Angular CLI and many other packages that had major updates after Mosh published his angular course. Many APIs also changed, for eg: angularfire2, rxjs, etc.

Happy Coding!

## Firebase Setup Note

You will have to setup your own firebase project and copy the config from your firebase project and paste it in the environments.ts and environments.prod.ts files.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
